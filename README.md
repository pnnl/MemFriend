**About**: A detailed understanding of data locality is an essential
tool for effective hardware/software co-design. Today's locality
analysis focuses on single memory locations and therefore can fail to
provide sufficient insight into correlations between memory regions
and data structures.

MemFriend, a new analysis module within the
[MemGaze](https://github.com/pnnl/memgaze) framework, introduces
spatial and temporal locality analysis that captures affinity (access
correlation) between pairs of memory locations. MemFriend's
multi-resolution analysis identifies significant memory segments and
simultaneously prunes the analysis space such that time and space
complexity is modest. MemFriend creates signatures, selectable at 3D,
2D, and 1D resolutions, that provide novel insights and enable
predictive reasoning about application performance. The results aid
data layout optimizations, and data placement decisions.
